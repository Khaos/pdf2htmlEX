remove unused glyphs

don't dump image when there is nothing

Integrate splash/cairo
native support for image
native support for draw

about glyph width:
 - IE
 - stretching ratio might not be correct.. letter 'f'

draw non-orthogonal lines with CSS

create a glyph for ' ', if there is not in a font

position history stack (popstate)

==Wait until someone asks==

try harder finding glyph names (using fontforge) for CID Type 0
rename single-html -> embed-font/image/css ...

merge sub/sup into one line
bug found in baidu(ubuntu...)
precise link dest: zoom


==Future==
argument auto-completion
use absolute positioning for long whitespace
color invert
detect duplicate base fonts when embedding
disable selection if we know unicode is wrong
combine lines (unwarp)
Printing
multiple charcode mapped to a same glyph
check if we can add information to the font, and let browsers show ligatures automatically
